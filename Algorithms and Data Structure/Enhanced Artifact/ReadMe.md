# Algorithms and Data Structure: OpenGL Scene Render

## Purpose
This OpenGL scene was originally created for a course during my program at Southern New Hampshire University. I performed this enhancement as part of my capstone course for my computer science program. This artifact was chosen to show my abilities in efficient algorithms, render logic, hierarchy, and scalability.
 
## Summary
This artifact creates a rendered scene modeled after a image of real world objects. Utilizing a pre-made library for objects, the scene creates as similar as possible replica of the real world scene. 

## Goal 
The artifact served as an introduction to 3D modeling, shaders, textures, and lighting. The scene used simple 3D objects to create the scene, focusing more on scale, how different materials interact with lighting, and how to properly illuminate a scene to illicit desired impressions from the viewer.
