# skeyelight.github.io

## Purpose
This repository was created for my capstone course for my program at Southern New Hampshire University. This is to serve as an ePortfolio, showcasing my abilities and skills as a software developer. There are 3 enhancements featured in this ePortfolio. Each focusing on a different aspect of software development; Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases. 

### [Software Design and Engineering](https://github.com/Skeyelight/skeyelight.github.io/tree/main/Software%20Design%20and%20Engineering)
The artifact chosen for the Software Design and Engineering enhancement is an Android mobile application. This enhancement was selected to apply newly learned concepts to an older project, perform needed architectural changes, and showcase knowledge in language migration. 

### [Algorithms and Data Structures](https://github.com/Skeyelight/skeyelight.github.io/tree/main/Algorithms%20and%20Data%20Structure)
This artifact began as a 3D rendered scene, where every object was rendered at once without any hierarchy among the objects. This resulted in every object calling the draw function and the transformation function. For my enhancement, I refactored the render logic of the objects, storing them inside a vector, traversing through the vector to render each object, and created a parent-child hierarchy for the objects. This resulted in less code duplication, and allows for scalability. 

### [Databases](https://github.com/Skeyelight/skeyelight.github.io/tree/main/Databases)
For my third enhancement, I sought to employ my knowledge of full-stack development. This transformed the artifact from a database with a GUI to apply pre-defined queries, to a full web application. These improvements allowed for custom queries, user-based roles, authentication, and performing CRUD operations directly from an admin page.
