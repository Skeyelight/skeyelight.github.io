# Kotlin Mobile Application

## Purpose
This mobile application was originally designed and written in Java for a course during my program at Southern New Hampshire University. 
I performed this enhancement as part of my capstone course for my computer science program. This artifact was chosen to show my abilities in language migration, using well-founded skill, and innovative techniques to implement solutions to accomplish industry specific goals.

## Summary
This is a simple weight tracking application. It allows the users to create accounts to track weights separately on shared devices, and allows for the use of shared guest account. Users can set a goal weight, which is displayed on the home page along with their most recent weight entry. Historical weight entries can be viewed on another page where weight entries can be modified or deleted. There are optional notifications upon the user meeting their goal weight. 

##Goal
The goal with creating this application was to provide users with a simple, intuitive way to track their daily weight and view their progress towards a goal. The intention was to remove any stress or barriers from tracking weight. There are no indicators for weight gain or loss, as these application is intended to be used by users trying to track weight loss, weight gain, or weight maintenance.
