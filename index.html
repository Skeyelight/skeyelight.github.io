        <div class="project-description">
            
            <p>
                The artifact chosen for the Software Design and Engineering enhancement was a Daily Weight Tracking application that was written in Java for CS-360: Mobile Architect & Programming. 
                It was created in October of 2025. I selected this artifact due to wanting to explore Kotlin as a programming language, and test my abilities in language migration, translating a program from Java to Kotlin. 
                It was fresh in my memory, having just recently developed the application. I also wanted to improve on the application utilizing the newest features in Android development. Rewriting an entire application in 
                a language that I had no formal knowledge of not only would showcase my ability to learn a new programming language but also highlight an ability to understand code structure and interpretation. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The artifact was improved by performing a complete rewrite into Kotlin, allowing for access to functions of Android development that Java programming does not have access to. Utilizing libraries and components 
                that were developed specifically for Android and Kotlin. This project shows that I can utilize well-founded and innovative skills and techniques to implement solutions to accomplish industry specific goals. 
            </p>

            <p>
                During this enhancement, I learned that jumping headfirst into a new programming language, even one that is derived from a language I am familiar with, is much more difficult than anticipated. 
                I have developed a new appreciation for learning the basics of a language before diving headfirst into a more complex project. There were many times during development that I would make what I 
                would have thought to be a simple change, and multiple areas of the project would begin to have issues. I felt that every time I added a new component, I would need to go back to previous components 
                to update them or completely rewrite them because I had not correctly coded them previously. I was too reliant on my knowledge of Java while developing in Kotlin. This project has given me insight into 
                the importance of having at least a base level knowledge of a programming language.
