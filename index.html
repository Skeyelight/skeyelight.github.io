            <p>
                During my time in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I explored many aspects of the field and broadened not only my understanding of the different roles that exist, but also my abilities as a developer. 
                This program allowed me to develop a firm understanding of my areas of proficiency and strength, while also understanding areas in which I need to still improve. From learning computer science fundamentals in scripting to creating a 
                full mobile application and full stack engineering, my technical skills improved as well as building competency in areas such as collaboration, communication, secure coding, and managing trade-offs to accomplish the goals set before me.	
            </p>

            <p>
                In my course work for Software Development Lifecycle, several students and I each took on different roles participating in mock SCRUM teams. Working together each week to analyze and discuss our current progress on a system we were developing 
                for a client. Changing roles during each stage of progression, showcasing understanding of each role’s responsibilities and working collaboratively to complete the project by the deadline. This course helped to foster an understanding of how 
                to build and work within a collaborative environment while also learning how to communicate effectively with stakeholders. Further communication and collaboration skills were developed in Software Analysis and Design, where I was introduced to 
                communicating to non-technical audiences, utilizing technical documentation and diagrams such as UML, flowcharts, and block charts for more effective means of communicating. 
            </p>

            <p>
                My foundation in data structure and algorithms is based on several courses over my time with the program. DSA: Analysis and Design introduced the concept of algorithms and data structures. This course explored different data structures, knowing 
                under which circumstances to apply certain data structures, and the algorithms needed to solve complex problems quickly and efficiently. The knowledge gained allowed me to succeed when developing a rendered scene in Computer Graphics and Visualization 
                and creating proper database queries to keep response time to a minimum. This fostered and reinforced my desire to create scalable and efficient code. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Regarding database design my abilities saw dramatic improvement during the program. Before beginning this program, I had only slightly touched on the concept of SQL and databases. The course Introduction to Structured Database Environments gave me a better 
                understanding of relational databases and how to properly utilize queries. During Client/Server Development, I learned the concept of Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD). Using these methods to create a dashboard to provide users with a GUI to interact 
                with the database. This was expanded upon in Full Stack Development, where I built a full web-application utilizing MongoDB, schemas, RESTful API, and role-base views.  
            </p>

            <p>
                I also made strides expanding my abilities in software engineering. This principle of computer science was addressed in several courses. Foundation in Application Development, Programming Languages, and Operating Platforms helped me in understanding compilation 
                and runtime behavior, object-oriented design, and design principles. These courses aid in teaching how to properly plan an application, the strengths and weaknesses of different programming languages, and understanding industry-best practices when approaching software development. 
            </p>

            <p>
                As a large focus of my desire to pursue a career in computer science, security has always been a defining element of my skillset. The course Software Security emphasized the importance of secure coding practices, encryption, and authentication. I learned the importance of validating 
                user input, managing sensitive data, minimizing attack surfaces, and developing software in a way the prioritizes user safety from the beginning. My goal is to work in a role that designs ethical software and protects user data. My coursework in this program reinforced the principles 
                of limiting unnecessary data collection, securely storing information, and properly disposing of data that is no longer needed. 
            </p>

            <p>
               The artifacts I choose to include in my ePortfolio help to form a comprehensive representation of my abilities. Each artifact was chosen to highlight a specific area of growth, and to demonstrate my ability to improve upon previous designs, integrate feedback, and maintain complex systems.
            </p>
            <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
                <li>My Android mobile application artifact, used in the Software Design and Engineering enhancement, illustrates a user first design, secure data management, and my ability to develop using modern frameworks. This artifact demonstrates knowledge on repositories, databases, backend logic, 
                state management, and error handling. These areas culminate in a showcase of strong software engineering practices. </li>
                <li>My OpenGL scene, used in the Algorithms and Data Structure enhancement, showcases my understanding of proper data structures and traversal algorithms. Showcasing this enhancement spotlights my knowledge of algorithms, optimization, and making meaningful updates to an existing system.</li>
                <li>The full stack web application artifact, used in the Databases enhancement, demonstrates my skills related to client/server development, database design, front-end and back-end technologies. The changes made for this enhancement highlight my skills in designing data models, building 
                scalable, maintainable systems, and implementing user authentication as well as view-based roles. </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
               These artifacts together show a wide range of my skillset and how I can work within many different facets of computer science. These enhancements highlight areas of growth from making basic programs to advanced development, my ability to solve problems using appropriate methodologies, maintain 
                existing software, and create full applications from design to deployment. This work shows the skillset that I bring to a role within the computer science field; a strong foundation and a clearly defined set of goals and values.

                The artifact chosen for the Software Design and Engineering enhancement was a Daily Weight Tracking application that was written in Java for CS-360: Mobile Architect & Programming. 
                It was created in October of 2025. I selected this artifact due to wanting to explore Kotlin as a programming language, and test my abilities in language migration, translating a program from Java to Kotlin. 
                It was fresh in my memory, having just recently developed the application. I also wanted to improve on the application utilizing the newest features in Android development. Rewriting an entire application in 
                a language that I had no formal knowledge of not only would showcase my ability to learn a new programming language but also highlight an ability to understand code structure and interpretation. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The artifact was improved by performing a complete rewrite into Kotlin, allowing for access to functions of Android development that Java programming does not have access to. Utilizing libraries and components 
                that were developed specifically for Android and Kotlin. This project shows that I can utilize well-founded and innovative skills and techniques to implement solutions to accomplish industry specific goals. 
            </p>

            <p>
                During this enhancement, I learned that jumping headfirst into a new programming language, even one that is derived from a language I am familiar with, is much more difficult than anticipated. 
                I have developed a new appreciation for learning the basics of a language before diving headfirst into a more complex project. There were many times during development that I would make what I 
                would have thought to be a simple change, and multiple areas of the project would begin to have issues. I felt that every time I added a new component, I would need to go back to previous components 
                to update them or completely rewrite them because I had not correctly coded them previously. I was too reliant on my knowledge of Java while developing in Kotlin. This project has given me insight into 
                the importance of having at least a base level knowledge of a programming language.

        <div class="project-description">
            
            <p>
                The artifact chosen for this enhancement was an OpenGL 3D scene that was created for CS-330: Comp Graphic and Visualization. This artifact was created August 22nd, 2025. I selected this artifact as I felt this 
                was the best artifact to showcase implementing a data structure and algorithm, where previously one did not exist. This artifact originally drew each 3D object individually and contained no relationships between 
                the objects in the scene. With the enhancements I made to the RenderScene method every object is now related through a hierarchical structure using parent-child relationship and stored in a vector. DrawNode then 
                traverses through the vector drawing each object. I also incorporated a method for using more complex 3D objects through tinygltf. This can be seen in Model.h and Model.cpp. When recreating the scene, I choose to 
                use a single Creative Commons complex model for the planchette, instead of using several simple objects. I added a check in CreateGLTexture to prevent too many textures from being loaded, causing data errors, and 
                refactored LoadSceneTextures. Previously LoadSceneTextures loaded each texture individually, with each texture calling the CreateGLTexture method. This has been altered to be one loop, that loads all the textures in a list. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I was able to successfully meet all the planned enhancements and even went a little further by adding the ability to use complex models. This project shows that I understand data structures and algorithms, and how to implement 
                them into an existing artifact. The enhancement presents evidence of using algorithmic principles and computer science practices while managing trade-offs. 	
            </p>

            <p>
                As opposed to my previous enhancement, this was very straightforward and utilized aspects of C++ I was familiar with. Leaning into my strengths to create this enhancement allowed me to approach modifying this artifact with confidence. 
                Approaching artifacts with this mindset would allow me to create a stronger ePortfolio and showcase my skills easier. Since this enhancement did require me to rebuild my 3D scene, I learned more about scale and ratios in 3D rendering. 
                When I initially created this artifact for my previous course, creating the scene was mostly trial and error. Spending more time with the scene and having to take the hierarchy into consideration allowed me to gain a better understanding 
                of the different values associated with 3D objects. The largest challenge I faced was trying to recreate the planchette from the previous version of the artifact. My planchette was made from seven different simple objects, scaled and positioned 
                to be aligned just right. After utilizing the hierarchical structure, even small changes to scale and position could cause a larger than anticipated change in the objects. Instead of spending many hours positioning each of these objects correctly, 
                I instead found a method for implementing complex objects into OpenGL through tinygltf. Not only did this allow me to quickly scale and position the complex planchette quickly, but this also allows for other complex objects to be utilized in the future.

                The artifact I chose for this enhancement was a MongoDB project that utilized a CRUD python file and a Jupyter Notebook file that created a basic interface to interact with the database. It was created for CS-340: Client/Server Development on August 22nd, 2025. 
                I selected this item as it was a basic implementation of a database with a client facing interface and utilized it to demonstrate my skill in database design and optimization.  As part of my planned enhancements, I sought to create a more complex client/server 
                system. For this artifact, I turned this simple interface into a full stack application, separating the client-side interface, the server-side logic, and the database into different layers. Utilizing an env file, the server connection link is no longer stored 
                directly in the program code. User information is now stored in the database and hashed as seen in the auth file. I also implemented role-based access, allowing admins to add new entries, as well as update and delete entries. 

            </p>

            <p>
                I was able to successfully meet my planned course outcomes. This enhancement allowed me to demonstrate my ability to implement well-founded techniques and utilize innovative tools in computing practices. I also showcased developing with a security mindset to 
                ensure privacy and enhance security of data. 	
            </p>

            <p>
                While I have built a full stack application for a previous course, it utilized Java, this artifact utilized Python. Having experience with Python, full-stack, and MongoDB, it was a matter of learning how to combine my skillsets to perform this enhancement. 
                I had not utilized a .env file before this project, so I was initially unaware of how to properly separate the database connection string from the project itself.
