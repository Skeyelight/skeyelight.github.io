        <h3 class="project-title">Software Design and Engineering Enhancement</h3>
        
        <div class="project-description">
            
            <p>
                The artifact chosen for the Software Design and Engineering enhancement was a Daily Weight Tracking application that was written in Java for CS-360: Mobile Architect & Programming. 
                It was created in October of 2025. I selected this artifact due to wanting to explore Kotlin as a programming language, and test my abilities in language migration, translating a program from Java to Kotlin. 
                It was fresh in my memory, having just recently developed the application. I also wanted to improve on the application utilizing the newest features in Android development. Rewriting an entire application in 
                a language that I had no formal knowledge of not only would showcase my ability to learn a new programming language but also highlight an ability to understand code structure and interpretation. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The artifact was improved by performing a complete rewrite into Kotlin, allowing for access to functions of Android development that Java programming does not have access to. Utilizing libraries and components 
                that were developed specifically for Android and Kotlin. This project shows that I can utilize well-founded and innovative skills and techniques to implement solutions to accomplish industry specific goals. 
            </p>

            <p>
                During this enhancement, I learned that jumping headfirst into a new programming language, even one that is derived from a language I am familiar with, is much more difficult than anticipated. 
                I have developed a new appreciation for learning the basics of a language before diving headfirst into a more complex project. There were many times during development that I would make what I 
                would have thought to be a simple change, and multiple areas of the project would begin to have issues. I felt that every time I added a new component, I would need to go back to previous components 
                to update them or completely rewrite them because I had not correctly coded them previously. I was too reliant on my knowledge of Java while developing in Kotlin. This project has given me insight into 
                the importance of having at least a base level knowledge of a programming language.

        <h3 class="project-title">Algorithms and Data Structures Enhancement</h3>
        
        <div class="project-description">
            
            <p>
                The artifact chosen for this enhancement was an OpenGL 3D scene that was created for CS-330: Comp Graphic and Visualization. This artifact was created August 22nd, 2025. I selected this artifact as I felt this 
                was the best artifact to showcase implementing a data structure and algorithm, where previously one did not exist. This artifact originally drew each 3D object individually and contained no relationships between 
                the objects in the scene. With the enhancements I made to the RenderScene method every object is now related through a hierarchical structure using parent-child relationship and stored in a vector. DrawNode then 
                traverses through the vector drawing each object. I also incorporated a method for using more complex 3D objects through tinygltf. This can be seen in Model.h and Model.cpp. When recreating the scene, I choose to 
                use a single Creative Commons complex model for the planchette, instead of using several simple objects. I added a check in CreateGLTexture to prevent too many textures from being loaded, causing data errors, and 
                refactored LoadSceneTextures. Previously LoadSceneTextures loaded each texture individually, with each texture calling the CreateGLTexture method. This has been altered to be one loop, that loads all the textures in a list. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I was able to successfully meet all the planned enhancements and even went a little further by adding the ability to use complex models. This project shows that I understand data structures and algorithms, and how to implement 
                them into an existing artifact. The enhancement presents evidence of using algorithmic principles and computer science practices while managing trade-offs. 	
            </p>

            <p>
                As opposed to my previous enhancement, this was very straightforward and utilized aspects of C++ I was familiar with. Leaning into my strengths to create this enhancement allowed me to approach modifying this artifact with confidence. 
                Approaching artifacts with this mindset would allow me to create a stronger ePortfolio and showcase my skills easier. Since this enhancement did require me to rebuild my 3D scene, I learned more about scale and ratios in 3D rendering. 
                When I initially created this artifact for my previous course, creating the scene was mostly trial and error. Spending more time with the scene and having to take the hierarchy into consideration allowed me to gain a better understanding 
                of the different values associated with 3D objects. The largest challenge I faced was trying to recreate the planchette from the previous version of the artifact. My planchette was made from seven different simple objects, scaled and positioned 
                to be aligned just right. After utilizing the hierarchical structure, even small changes to scale and position could cause a larger than anticipated change in the objects. Instead of spending many hours positioning each of these objects correctly, 
                I instead found a method for implementing complex objects into OpenGL through tinygltf. Not only did this allow me to quickly scale and position the complex planchette quickly, but this also allows for other complex objects to be utilized in the future.

        <div class="project-description">
            
            <p>
                The artifact I chose for this enhancement was a MongoDB project that utilized a CRUD python file and a Jupyter Notebook file that created a basic interface to interact with the database. It was created for CS-340: Client/Server Development on August 22nd, 2025. 
                I selected this item as it was a basic implementation of a database with a client facing interface and utilized it to demonstrate my skill in database design and optimization.  As part of my planned enhancements, I sought to create a more complex client/server 
                system. For this artifact, I turned this simple interface into a full stack application, separating the client-side interface, the server-side logic, and the database into different layers. Utilizing an env file, the server connection link is no longer stored 
                directly in the program code. User information is now stored in the database and hashed as seen in the auth file. I also implemented role-based access, allowing admins to add new entries, as well as update and delete entries. 

            </p>

            <p>
                I was able to successfully meet my planned course outcomes. This enhancement allowed me to demonstrate my ability to implement well-founded techniques and utilize innovative tools in computing practices. I also showcased developing with a security mindset to 
                ensure privacy and enhance security of data. 	
            </p>

            <p>
                While I have built a full stack application for a previous course, it utilized Java, this artifact utilized Python. Having experience with Python, full-stack, and MongoDB, it was a matter of learning how to combine my skillsets to perform this enhancement. 
                I had not utilized a .env file before this project, so I was initially unaware of how to properly separate the database connection string from the project itself.
