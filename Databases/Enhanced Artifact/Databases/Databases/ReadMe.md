# Databases: Animal Shelter Database and Dashboard

## Purpose
The original artifact was created for a course during my program at Southern New Hampshire University. I performed this enhancement as part of my capstone course for my computer science program. This artifact was chosen to show my abilities in databases, queries, full-stack development and user authentication. 

## Summary
The original artifact was created as an introduction to a client/server relationship. Utilizing a dashboard to interact with the database using pre-defined queries to select adoptable animals best suited for different forms of search and rescue operations. The dashboard was a view only GUI, lacking options for adding, updating, or deleting entries. 

## Goal 
The goal with the original artifact was to create a interactive dashboard to make finding suitable animals easy to find. The enhancement performed on this artifact transitioned to a full stack application, complete with user authentication, and an admin view enabling CRUD operations to be performed from the GUI. This also came with the ability to use custom queries using filters and search.
